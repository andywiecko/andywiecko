## About Me

In my free time, I develop the [**PBD2D**][PBD2D] engine â€” a physics engine for two-dimensional soft-body simulations within the Unity Burst compiler. 
You can find demo scenes for this project [**here**](https://andywiecko.github.io/PBD2D-examples). 
Additionally, I actively develop [**Burst Triangulator**][burst-triangulator], an efficient Unity Delaunay triangulation package with constraints and refinement support.

I am primarily interested in:

- simulation
- game physics
- computer graphics
- quantum computing.

I'm passionate about all things related to science ðŸ¤“.
