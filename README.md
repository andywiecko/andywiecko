# Andrzej WiÄ™ckowski, Ph.D.

## Current appointment

Currently, I am part of the physics engine team at [**Laparo Simulators**][laparo].
We are developing the software that will be used in laparoscopic simulators.
My main responsibility is research and development in the area of soft body dynamics.
I conduct a literature review, do analytical calculations, implement the physical problems concerning professional software development practices, and perform computation optimization.

## Past appointments

I was the researcher at WrocÅ‚aw University of Science and Technology in the [Department of Theoretical Physics][polibuda] for over 2 years.
I defended my Ph.D. after 2 years! This is my lifetime achievement.
My thesis topic was related to Majorana quasiparticles (topological quantum computers).
I published a few papers in respectful journals, one can find them [**here**][papers].

## Personal info

In my free time I develop **PBD2D** engine, for two-dimensional soft-body physics within the [Unity Burst][burst] compiler, which preview one can find on my [Twitter][twitter].
Current implementation supports simulation of one, two-dimensional structures, fluid (experimental) within various interaction between them like collisions, connectors, or dragging with mouse.

I am interested mostly in simulation, game physics, computer graphics.

I like science stuff ðŸ¤“
